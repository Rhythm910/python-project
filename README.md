Student Performance Analysis
This project analyzes a dataset (student_scores.csv) sourced from Kaggle, containing demographic and academic performance data of students. The goal is to explore relationships between background factors and scores in Math, Reading, and Writing.

📁 Dataset Overview
Filename: student_scores.csv
Source: Kaggle 

🔍 Project Goals
Analyze correlations between demographics and academic performance.
Visualize insights using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
Identify key factors that may affect student outcomes.

🧪 Libraries Used
pandas for data manipulation
numpy for numerical operations
matplotlib and seaborn for visualization.

🔍 Objectives
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and relationships.
Handle missing values in categorical and numerical fields.
Visualize data using Seaborn and Matplotlib to discover trends.
Compare academic scores by gender, ethnicity, and other socio-economic factors.
Examine how lifestyle attributes (sports, study hours, transport) affect performance.
Optionally apply machine learning models to predict student scores.

📊 Sample Analysis Ideas
Average scores by Gender or ParentEduc
Boxplots comparing LunchType and performance
Heatmap of correlation between MathScore, ReadingScore, and WritingScore
Bar plots showing the effect of WklyStudyHours on total score

Unnecessary columns (like Unnamed: 0) can be dropped
